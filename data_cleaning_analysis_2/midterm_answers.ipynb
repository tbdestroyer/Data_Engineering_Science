Pandas mean() also ignores the NaN values so keep as is probably a good option rather than imputing with a central tendency. I also run a t-test between votes_df with 15 non-null values and dropped_df with 11 non-null values and with the null hypothesis that there is no significant difference between them shows that p-value is 0.81 and my null hypothesis is true so keeping the missing values as is is acceptable."
